<h2>Task</h2>
    <p>John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48 and $268.</p>
    <p>To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a function). He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.</p>
    <p>In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Containing all three tips (one for each bill)</li>
        <li>Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).</li>
    </ol>
